  abstract={This paper introduces a radical reimagining of SAT solving through the lens of quantum vacuum fluctuations and the Casimir effect. We present a physics-inspired approach where partial variable assignments are treated as physical microstates in an energy landscape, with "almost-satisfying" configurations experiencing attractive Casimir-like forces that cause coagulation into stable solution clusters. Our method demonstrates how domain wall formation and vacuum dynamics can naturally guide the system toward satisfying assignments without explicit backtracking, offering a novel paradigm for NP-complete problem solving.},
