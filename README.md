## About This Blog

This blog presents a radical reimagining of SAT solving through the lens of quantum vacuum fluctuations and the Casimir effect. We explore how partial variable assignments can be treated as physical microstates in an energy landscape, with "almost-satisfying" configurations experiencing attractive Casimir-like forces that cause coagulation into stable solution clusters.

Itâ€™s a new way of thinking about computation as a physical process. The integration of quantum vacuum dynamics into Boolean logic is as imaginative as it is rigorous. With minor theoretical tightening and hybridization for structured problems, this could become a foundational approach in the next generation of constraint-solving algorithms.
