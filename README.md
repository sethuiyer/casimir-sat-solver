# Casimir SAT Blog

A physics-inspired approach to SAT solving through quantum vacuum fluctuations and the Casimir effect.

## About This Blog

This blog presents a radical reimagining of SAT solving through the lens of quantum vacuum fluctuations and the Casimir effect. We explore how partial variable assignments can be treated as physical microstates in an energy landscape, with "almost-satisfying" configurations experiencing attractive Casimir-like forces that cause coagulation into stable solution clusters.
